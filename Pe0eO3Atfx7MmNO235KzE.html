                                     <strong>How to lose weight after 45 years</strong><p><span>At a certain age, excess weight becomes a pressing and common problem. Among young people, only a tenth suffer from obesity, and after reaching adulthood, every second complains about the fullness. The body is rebuilt and begins to work in a different way, and the lifestyle, laziness, employment, lack of motivation and desire to overcome circumstances, fatigue and poor health prevent you from taking a decisive step and achieving positive results.<br></span></p><p><span>Excess weight negatively affects health: the load on the legs increases and joints suffer from it, pain appears, shortness of breath; muscles atrophy, the vessels become clogged and blood flow is bad. Chronic diseases escalate, and the risk of a stroke or heart attack increases several times. Lack of movement, physical activity, and poor health do not improve your mood. Depression, anxiety and discomfort appear, sleep is disrupted, memory deteriorates and attention.<br></span></p><div><div></div></div><p><span>Therefore, the recommendations of doctors are the main reason for weight loss in age. Although there are also strong-minded people who strive to be attractive, win hearts and new heights, travel and be active. But losing weight after 45-50 years has its own characteristics, and they should not be used neglect, so as not to harm your health and stress does not provoke a deterioration in your overall condition.<br></span></p><p><span>Reasons for being full in middle age<br>The metabolism worsens with age, that is, it slows down. This means that fewer calories are consumed. And the lifestyle becomes less active, mobile and energetic. On the appearance of extra pounds also affects:<br>heredity;<br>aging;<br>hormonal change;<br>climax and midlife crisis;<br>consequences of pregnancy (in women);<br>employment.<br></span></p><p><span>Heredity certainly plays a role. Genes determine the physique, but the idea that children are fat parents must necessarily suffer from obesity, science has long refuted. If you do not believe that much depends on the person, his perseverance and efforts, it is quite difficult to achieve success. Eating habits and rules are more influential: it's just that some families eat more than others.<br>Menopause and menopause change dramatically hormonal balance in a woman's body. Estrogens, estradiol, progesterone and estrone are produced less. That is why, and not because of a bad mood or boredom, women begin to eat more: they simply increase their appetite. </span></p><p><span>For good health and slimness, also the necessary hormones: oxytocin, leptin, cortisol and insulin. Late pregnancy affects the hormonal balance, provoking deposits of adipose tissue on the abdomen and thighs. It is necessary to regularly undergo examinations by an endocrinologist and gynecologist and correctly select the necessary medications for health.<br></span></p><p><span>Men are also more likely to gain weight at 35-40 years of age: they have the level of testosterone decreases. They have a "beer belly": for some reason, fat is deposited in the waist area. This is not only dangerous for weight, but can lead to diabetes and heart disease. Therefore, physical exertion and dieting are often not a whim, but a medical necessity.<br></span></p><p><span>After 50 years, many people they are already achieving stability and prosperity. They stop working part-time and become scattered, but pay a lot of attention to their main work and household, leaving no time for rest and self-improvement. Children grow up and leave their father's house. Family life develops into a new, quiet phase. People don't move much, don't move fast. they experience a spiritual uplift, can wallow with laziness, routine and boredom. And to start doing sports at this age is scary: there are many fears to damage your health, disrupt the usual course of life.<br></span></p><p><span>In fact, weight is 95% determined by the diet. People simply overeat, get carried away too much they eat a lot of fat and high-calorie food, eat a lot of cakes and pastries, eat too much before going to bed and can not deny themselves food pleasures. By the age of 50, you already need to learn to love yourself, know your characteristics, and not make sudden changes in life, but just slightly adjust your habits.<br></span></p><p><span>Basic rules for losing weight at 45 years old<br>In adulthood, it is necessary to understand all age-related changes that occur in the body. Weight loss should not be abrupt. It is important to take into account the peculiarities of your body and consult your doctor regularly. Will be contraindicated:<br>starvations;<br>strict diet;<br>excessive physical activity loads;<br>uncontrolled admission of pre-graduates;<br>stresses;<br>sudden changes in the daily routine and nutrition.<br>Everything should be done with pleasure, set yourself real goals, for example, to lose weight by 2 kg in a month. Drastic weight loss is not recommended, because:<br>your skin will SAG and your body will look worse;<br>the toxins will be released and pollute the blood;<br>the kidneys and liver may not be able to withstand the changes.<br></span></p><p><span>Light training, walking in the fresh air, more movement, communication and joy in life will only benefit. It will be useful to engage in self-education, carefully think through each step, listen to yourself, but look at weight loss with optimism. Should:<br>there is less sweet and flour;<br>do not overuse salt;<br>to drink vitamins;<br>take calcium, magnesium, iron in an optimal and well-digested form;<br>do fitness classes;<br>don't forget about love and sex;<br>make fast days;<br>replace sauces and mayonnaise with sunflower oil;<br>to visit doctors;<br>positively tune in and don't be nervous.<br></span></p><p><span>Food<br></span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><span>The main focus should be on a healthy diet. The diet should be dominated by whole grains, vegetables, meat and fish, and fruits. Tea is better to drink without sugar. Do not forget about fermented milk products foods: they contain a lot of calcium, which is useful for weakened, fragile bones. Small portions are divided into 4-5 receptions. </span></p><p><span>It will be useful to observe, think and read more about products that are good for health. Perhaps inexpensive but healthy kohlrabi, ginger, pumpkin, celery, avocado, berries or grapefruit will benefit for the body and will bring variety to the diet. And exotic foods – Goji berries, pineapples or durian-should be treated with caution – it is not known how the body will react. </span></p><p><span>The use of high-calorie vegetables and fruits: potatoes, bananas, can be limited. And from harmful coffee, canned food, sausages, sauces, salted fish, fried and pickled, ice cream, white bread is better to refuse. These foods contain too many chemical elements, preservatives, and colorants, and the liver and kidneys can be sensitive to them, causing negative reactions in the stomach.<br></span></p><p><span>With age, the thirst may become less pronounced than in the past youths. However, drink 1, 5-2 liters of water per day. The liquid will help keep your skin supple and hydrated, improve your metabolism, and just feel good.<br></span></p><p><span>Moderate traffic<br>When trying to lose weight after 45 years, you should especially carefully adhere to the principles of moderation, consistency and gradations. In the morning, it is important to do a little exercise, 10-15 minutes is enough. </span></p><p><span>It includes exercises for all muscle groups to tone the body and recharge energy. Every day it is necessary to go out for walks and breathe air at least on the way to business or to the store. You can also choose a sport that I like: shaping, dancing or swimming and regularly go to classes. Loads should be increased gradually, each week increasing the number of exercises or the duration of training. And for the heart, oddly enough, you need cardio exercises – running or Cycling, and for them you need to find a few minutes in your office a busy schedule.<br></span></p><p><span>It is important to get enough sleep and lead an active social life. Following these simple rules, paying attention to health, you can lose weight, become happier, make new friends, find interesting activities and feel young and beautiful. </span></p><div></div>
